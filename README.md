# News Page
Using the free NewsAPI API, I built this simple application to scrape news stories from reputable sources and compile them in a Streamlit app to help keep me up to date with the fast-paced world of AI, finance and politics. 

To run this yourself, get a free API from NewsAPI, add it to this project and run the command `streamlit run app.py`.
